 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
 * For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would becomes `a2b1c5a3`.
 * If the "Compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should
 * return the original string.
 *
 * You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z)
